# Introduction
This repo contains artifacts for my amazonwebshark tech blog.  This repo was created to remove the need for multiple smaller repos containing only a couple of files, and to reduce the amount of GitHub Gists to make them easier to navigate.

## What This Repo Contains
The following list is not exhaustive:

- Architecture Diagrams, either as images and/or as the [Diagrams.Net](https://app.diagrams.net/) code used to generate them.
- Scripts of actual solutions, with redactions where needed.
- Scripts of hypothetical solutions within the blog's context.
- Supporting content for posts that may not have been used in the final product.

## What This Repo Doesn't Contain
- Solutions, redacted or otherwise, where it makes sense for them to have their own repos (for instance, a Python module)
- Code snippets that have a good reason to be on GitHub Gists (for example, I want to embed them into the post instead of posting a link)

# Advisory
Scripts within this repo have been written at various points along my learning journey.  They do not represent best practices, may include unexpected bugs, and may become obsolete.  Please keep this in mind.

# Contents
This list will start with the most recently dated entry, working backwards.
